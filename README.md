The Boost Physio Clinic (BPC) Booking System is developed to manage the appointments and treatments provided by the clinic's physiotherapists. The system enables patients to view available treatments, book appointments by expertise or physiotherapist, and manage their treatment history. For administrative purposes, the clinic can generate detailed reports at the end of a treatment term.
